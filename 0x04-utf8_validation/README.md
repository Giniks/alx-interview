## Project Title
UTF-8 Validation

## Overview
This project implements a Python method named `validUTF8(data)` to determine if a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. The method checks each byte in the provided data list and applies the UTF-8 encoding rules to validate its encoding. It verifies the number of bytes in each character sequence and examines the patterns of leading bits in each byte to ensure compliance with UTF-8 encoding standards.
