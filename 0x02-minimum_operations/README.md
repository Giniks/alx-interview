## Project: Minimum Operations

## Topic:
In a text file, there is a single character 'H'. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n 'H' characters in the file.

## Review:
The script calculates the minimum number of operations required to generate n 'H' characters in a text file using only 'Copy All' and 'Paste' operations.

## Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to implement a method that determines the minimum number of operations needed to achieve a specific number of 'H' characters in a text file using only 'Copy All' and 'Paste' operations.

## Project Tasks:
- Implement the minOperations function that takes an integer n and returns the minimum number of operations required to generate n 'H' characters.
- If n is impossible to achieve, return 0.
