# Star Wars API Project

## Overview:
The "0. Star Wars Characters" project requires you to interact with an external API to fetch and display information about Star Wars characters based on the movie ID provided as an argument. This project aims to demonstrate your ability to work with external APIs and manage asynchronous code in JavaScript.

## Concepts Needed:
- **HTTP Requests in JavaScript:**
  - Understanding how to make HTTP requests to external services using libraries like `request` or built-in functions like `fetch` in Node.js.
- **Working with APIs:**
  - Understanding RESTful APIs and parsing JSON data returned by APIs.
- **Asynchronous Programming:**
  - Managing asynchronous operations using callbacks, promises, or async/await syntax.
- **Command Line Arguments in Node.js:**
  - Using `process.argv` to access command-line arguments passed to a Node.js script.
- **Array Manipulation and Iteration:**
  - Iterating over arrays and manipulating data structures.

## Requirements:
- **Environment:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with Node.js (version 10.14.x)
- **Editor:** Allowed editors include vi, vim, and emacs
- **File Structure:** All files should end with a new line and start with `#!/usr/bin/node`
- **README.md:** Mandatory file providing project description and instructions
- **Code Style:** Semistandard compliant with semicolons and AirBnB style as reference
- **Execution:** All files must be executable

## Tasks:
1. **0. Star Wars Characters:**
   - Write a script that prints all characters of a Star Wars movie based on the Movie ID provided as the first positional argument.
   - Use the Star Wars API and the request module.
